## Bedtime Adventures - My first independent React build

## Bedtime Adventures summary

Welcome to "Bedtime Adventures"!

In this simple game, your mission is clear: gently guide your child into the land of dreams. We all know that achieving this bedtime bliss is a delicate dance of routine and comfort. From cozy blankets to soothing melodies, every item plays a crucial role in setting the stage for a restful night.

Navigate through the list of sleep-inducing items, each chosen to lull your little one into sweet slumber. But be mindful in your choices, avoiding anything that might spark nighttime energy. It's a game of strategy and care, where success means a peaceful night for both you and your child.

Are you ready to embark on this bedtime journey? Choose wisely, and may bedtime magic be on your side!

## Project detail 

Bedtime Adventures is my first personal React build, which is not a response to an Academi Xi project. 

Bedtime Adventures is a simple game, where users can select from a number of items to try to get "their" kid to fall asleep. Each item has a number of points attached that will either add to or deduct from the total number of points the user has. 

The aim of the game is to get to 100 points, at which point the user will have won the game, ie, got their kid to fall asleep. If the user gets to 0 points or run out of items they will have lost the game. 

At certain point totals the kid will either start to look more awake or more tired to cue the user to whether or not they are close to winning or loosing. 

The web app is used for my own personal purposes to continue working on my skills in React. It uses a lot of conditional rendering to achieve a game-like feel. 

I have added styling using CSS. 

## Getting started

Please use Chrome as your browser for the best experience. 

The app has only been tested on Chrome and Safari, which are the most commonly used browsers in Australia (source: https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share/all/australia).

## Acknowledgement

The app features vector files, which I have downloaded from FreePik, https://www.freepik.com/. This includes all images used in  the belt, all app logos and the vector of the girl in bed. 

All vector files have been edited by me in Adobe Illustrator, and the animations have been done using a combination of Adobe Illustrator and https://ezgif.com/maker.
